Info(writegeom):
 EXCITING lattice vectors and atomic positions written to geometry.xml
 
Info(dos):
 Total density of states written to TDOS.OUT
 
 Partial density of states written to PDOS_Sss_Aaaaa.OUT
 for all species and atoms
 
 Eigenvalues of a random matrix in the (l, m) basis symmetrised
 with the site symmetries written to ELMIREP.OUT for all
 species and atoms. Degenerate eigenvalues correspond to
 irreducible representations of each site symmetry group
 
 Interstitial density of states written to IDOS.OUT
 
 Fermi energy is at zero in plot
 
 DOS units are states/Hartree/unit cell
