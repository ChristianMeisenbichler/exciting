INFORMATION ON HOWTO BUILD SERIAL AND PARALLEL EXECUTABLES

The directories "serial" and "parallel" are provided for building
serial and parallel executables independently.

Building serial or parallel executables:

(1) Go to either of the directories "serial" or "parallel"

    Copy or link one of the "make.inc*" templates there
    to "make.inc" or create your own "make.inc" file.

(2) First you have to build the libraries: This is done by

	make libs

    You should now have obtained the files "blas.a", "lapack.a", "fftlib.a"
    and "libbzint.a"

    Alternatively, you can build any of the libraries separately
    by invoking

        make {blas|lapack|fftlib|libbzint}

(3) Second, you build the main part of the code by invoking

	make

    or

	make {serial|parallel}

(4) If not specified otherwise, an executable with the name "exciting" or 
    "excitingmpi" resides in the "serial" or "parallel" directory depending on 
    where you are building and is ready for execution. The executable is also
    distributed to the (parent) build-directory.
