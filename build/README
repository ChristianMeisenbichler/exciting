INFORMATION ON HOWTO BUILD EXECUTABLES

The directories "serial" and "parallel" are provided for building
serial and parallel executables independently.

Building serial or parallel executables:

(1) Go to one of the subdirectories, e.g. to "serial" or "parallel"

    Copy or link one of the "make.inc*" templates there
    to "make.inc" or create your own "make.inc" file.

(2) First you have to build the libraries: This is done by

	make libs

    You should now have obtained the files "libblas.a", "liblapack.a",
    "fftlib.a","libbzint.a" and "libarpack.a"

    Alternatively, you can build any of the libraries separately
    by invoking

        make {libblas.a|liblapack.a|fftlib.a|libbzint.a|libarpack.a}

(3) Second, you build the main part of the code by invoking

	make

(4) If not specified otherwise, an executable with the name "exciting" or 
    "exciting*" resides in the subdirectory of choice, e.g. "serial" or
    "parallel" and is ready for execution. The executable is also
    distributed to the (parent) build-directory.
