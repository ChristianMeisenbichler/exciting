This is a beta release of the EXCITING FP-LAPW code. The code can be compiled  by 
running the setup script

perl setup.pl

in this directory. After choosing the platform you will be asked wether you want 
to build a k-point parallel version using MPI and a version that uses multithreaded 
BLAS/LAPACK. Choose yes or no dependent on if you have the required libraries 
installed on your system. You can manually edit the make.inc in the build directory.

The auxiliary programs include "spacegroup" for producing crystal geometries
from spacegroup data, "species" for generating species files, and "eos" for
fitting equations of state to energy-volume data.

EXCITING is updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. This release may
be used for limited production but please check the consistency of the results
carefully.
